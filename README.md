This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run:
#  1:   Open Terminal (for client side)
#           cd into: Desktop/Project Router/ the one with routes
#              'npm start' 

#  2:   Open Terminal (for server side, Heroku)
#           cd into: Desktop/Project Router/ the one with routes/ server
#               'node index.js' 

## Working thus-far:
#   -Connecting to app in locahost
#   -Connecting to heroku server 
#   -Registering via localhost:3000/register
#       - Register page is good. No additional work needed here.
#   -Signing in to server via localhost:3000 
#       - Sign in page is good. No additional work needed here.
#       (this is the default landing page for now...
#        Can change this in /src/routes/index.js)

## To - Do:
#   -Add header with working links to pages
#       -header links are there now
#           -but they don't change the render, only the url...
